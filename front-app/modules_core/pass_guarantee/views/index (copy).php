            <p>If you want to drive a car you'll need to pass the driving theory test before booking the car practical driving test. There are 2 parts to the theory test:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>the multiple choice questions part</li>
                <li>the hazard perception part</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Both parts of the test are taken on the same day. You need to pass both parts to pass the theory test. You'll then get a theory test pass certificate. You'll need the certificate number when you book your practical test.
