            <div>
              <p>Each of the hazard perception videos contain at least one developing hazard. A developing hazard is one which will eventually cause you to change course, speed or even to stop.Each time you think you spot such a hazard developing in the video, click anywhere on the video. Every time you click the video, a red flag is shown under the video.Each hazard carries a maximum score of 5 points, the earlier you spot the hazard the higher your score will be. As the hazard 
      develops, the maximum you can score decreases until the hazard has passed at which point you will score zero.You will not be able to review your answers to the hazard perception test; as on the road, you will only have one chance to respond to the developing hazard.
      Do not get into the habit of repeatedly clicking the mouse button as in the real DVSA test you will be penalised for this and score zero marks for the video.Spotting the developing hazards early on takes some practice so don't be discouraged if at first you score low marks.
      Above all, remember to concentrate and stay alert.</p>

            <h4>Hints and tips</h4>
            <div>
              <p>
                The hazard perception clips simulate real life hazards you may encounter on the roads. Below is a list of the sort of things you need to watch out for:
                <ul>
                  <li>Pedestrians / cyclists crossing the road</li>
                  <li>Pedestrians walking out from behind buses</li>
                  <li>Cyclists / motorcyclists changing course</li>
                  <li>Unsupervised children / children playing</li>
                  <li>Children running out from between parked cars</li>
                  <li>Unrestrained animals</li>
                  <li>Animals hiding under parked cars</li>
                  <li>Vehicles joining the road ahead of you</li>
                  <li>Large vehicles turning as they may need both sides of the road</li>
                  <li>Vehicle doors opening</li>
                  <li>Narrow roads where oncoming vehicles may be in the middle of the road</li>
                  <li>Unmarked junctions where nobody has priority</li>
                  <li>Pedestrians who are preoccupied - for example running to catch a bus</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
            </div>
            
            <h4>Example scenarious</h4>
            <div>
              <p>As an example of how to identify and respond to a developing hazard, consider a parked vehicle on the side of the road. When you first see it, it is not doing anything; it is just a parked vehicle. If you were to respond to the vehicle at this point, you would not score any marks, but you would not lose any marks. 
      
      However, when you get closer to the vehicle, you notice that the car's right hand indicator starts to flash. The indicator would lead you to believe that the driver of the vehicle has an intention of moving away, therefore the hazard is now developing and a response at this point would score marks. The indicator coming on is a sign that the parked vehicle has changed its status from a potential hazard into a developing hazard. </p>
            </div>
            
            <h4>The real test</h4>
            <div>
              <p>The hazard perception part of the test is delivered on a computer and you respond by clicking a button on the mouse. You will be presented with a series of 14 video clips which feature every day road scenes, in each clip there will be at least one developing hazard, but one of the clips will feature two developing hazards. </p>
